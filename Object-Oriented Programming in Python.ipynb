    "Classes, Objects, and Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "@Authors: Sridhar Nerur, Samuel Jayaraj, and Mahyar Vaghefi\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will introduce you to abstract data types/classes, their instances (i.e., objects), and inheritance. The advent of languages like Smalltalk, followed by C++ and Java changed the way developers conceptualized and built software systems. Erstwhile approaches - referred to as structured systems development - privileged algorithms and functions to data. For example, when programmers developed systems using the structured paradigm, they visualized the system as a hierarchy of functions using diagrams (e.g., Data Flow Diagrams and structured charts). The process model, which emphasized actions and functions, was developed independent of the data model (e.g., entity relationship diagram). In other words, data and the functions that operated on the data were not seen as one encapsulated whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "The object-oriented paradigm, which places emphasis on the encapsulation of data and related functions, changed the way developers analyzed and designed software systems. Central to this paradigm is the notion of a class, which is an abstraction that combines/encapsulates data and related functions and usually maps on to real-world concepts of interest in the domain under development.  Examples of classes include Customers, Orders, Shipment, Invoice, Payment, Employees, Account, SavingAccount, Reservation, Renewal, and so forth. You may also think of a class as an abstraction that represents a set of instances or objects that have similar characteristics and behaviors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I have used the term object several times without defining it. An object is an instance of a class. For example, my Savings Account at Bank XYZ is one occurrence of a Savings Account. This account is uniquely associated with me, has a certain balance, is subject to some rules (e.g., a minimum balance to be maintained) that apply equally to all savings accounts in Bank XYZ, and so on. My friend, Doug, may also have a savings account in the same bank. Doug's savings account would be identified by a unique id, would have its own balance, and would be linked to Doug and not me (as much as I would like to access his $$$!). These two instances of a Saving Account at Bank XYZ (i.e., my account and Doug's) are called SavingsAccount objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object has:\n",
    "a) Identity: This uniquely identifies an object.\n",
    "b) State: Defined by the values of its attributes and references to other objects.\n",
    "c) Behavior: These are actions that you can perform on an object. For example, you can withdraw money from or deposit money into an account.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class can be abstract or concrete. An abstract class is one that cannot be instantiated. That is, you cannot create an instance of that class. For example, in a banking application, the notion of Account is abstract, because you open a type of account (Savings or Checkings) not an Account. Of course, Savings and Checkings have the similar attributes and behaviors and are \"sub classes\" of Account that can be instantiated. Likewise, a Mammal class would be abstract (we see sub-classes of Mammal - Dogs, Persons, etc.) but a Dog, which is a mammal, can be instantiated. In contrast to an abstract class, concrete classes can be instantiated. The more abstract a class the more general it is, and the more concrete a class the more specialized it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of concepts before we start coding. First, we have something called inheritance, something that allows you to create sub-classes that acquire the attributes and methods of a super class. For example, a banking application could have a very general class called Account that has attributes that are common to types of accounts that the bank offers. The types of accounts - Savings Account, Checking Account, Money Manager Account, Loan Account - are more specialized accounts that not only share the attributes and behaviors of the super class (i.e., Account) but also may have their own characteristics (i.e., attributes and references) and methods. In this example, Account is abstract (more general) and the sub-classes Savings Account and Checking Account are both concrete, as those are the accounts we open in a bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "As one can see, inheritance allows reuse, helps to avoid duplication of code, and allows us to extend our application easily (for example, by adding a new sub-class). Inheritance also allows for polymorphism, a principle that allows a client to deal with any object without knowing which specific sub-class the object belongs to. For example, a client that handles transactions on an account doesn't have to know whether the object it is handling is a Savings Account object or a Checking ACcount instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have the key concepts out of the way, let us see how Python provides support for object-oriented concepts. We will see two examples. The first will be a single container class that behaves like a Queue. Items are added to the end of the queue and are processed/serviced in sequence from the beginning of the queue. The second example will involve a small banking class with Account, Saving Account, and Checking Account."

    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We always start with: class ClassName: or class ClassName(SuperClass):\n",
    "In our example, we are inheriting from the root class of Python called object. So, we could have also started our class as follows:\n",
    "class Queue(object):\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The __init__() [Note that it has two leading and two trailing underscores] is a special method that is onvoked when we try to create an instance of the class (i.e., when we try to create an object). The first paramter of __init__() is always \"self\", which is a reference to the current object. One may pass other parameters depending on the class being created. The __init__() methods serves as a constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Note that all the other methods in thr Queue class have \"self\" as their first parameter. Every instance method - a method that is associated with the instance and not the ENTIRE class - will have \"self\" as the first parameter. In contrast, there are what are known as class methods or static methods that should have no reference to self. We will see this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us try to create some instances of our queue and see if the methods work.\n"
