    "Congratulations on having made it so far. The ability to work with Strings is critical in Python (and in other languages as well). You may recall that a string in python is one or more characters enclosed in single, double, or triple quotes. Languages such as Java use single quotes for characters and double quotes for strings. As with other languages, a single character (e.g., \"a\") maps on to an integer value. Let us get started."

    "So, now you know how to get a specific character from a string. What if we wanted to extract a substring, say, the first three characters or the last three characters? Python uses something called \"slicing\" that allows you do exactly that. The general form of slicing is as follows:\n",
