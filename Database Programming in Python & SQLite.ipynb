    "In this notebook, we show you how to use a built-in database API module called sqlite3. It provides direct access to database tables/files through functions available in a SQLite. A database is a collection of related tables. Tables are also referred to as relations. Each table, in turn, will consist of related fields or attributes. For example, we may have a table called \"Customers\", which would have fields such as customer_id, last_name, first_name, and address. This tutorial assumes that you know the basics of databases - tables, normalization, primary and foreign keys, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we do is to connect to an existing database or one that we wish to create. We will create a database called \"movie_app.db\" and then use SQL (Structured Query Language) to create and populate tables in the database. We will also show you how to use SQL, a declarative language, to query the database. This tutorial will not get into the details of SQL. If you wish to learn more about SQL - something we would highly recommend - you may go to https://www.w3schools.com/sql/ for a nice tutorial. \n",
