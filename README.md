# Introduction-to-Python
The notebooks in this repository were created to help students who are starting off with Python. You will find very simple IPython notebooks that cover the fundamentals of Python. In our opinion, the only way to learn Python - or any other language - is by doing it. These IPython notebooks are ideal for experimenting with the language.

As you go through the notebooks, you will encounter a number of built-in as well as external Python modules. The ones you should install are given below (you will also find this information in the notebooks):

Pandas
Numpy
Seaborn
Basemap and Cartopy
py-readability-metrics
Spacy
TextBlob
NLTK
geonamescache
yellowbrick

Note that we have not organized the notebooks by chapter. If you are new to Python, we would recommend the following sequence:
1. Variables - introduction to Python
2. Print function
3. Strings
4. Lists
5. Sets & Tuples
6. Dictionary
7. Programming constructs
8. Functions
9. File Handling
10. Exception Handling
11. Basics of Text Analysis
12. Analyzing tweets - an introduction
13. Database programming with Python


This is a work-in-progress, so look for updates periodically.
